## 📋 Task

Implement V2 portfolio design based on Figma files and screenshots.
Analyse each and every screenshot pixel-by-pixel to ensure fidelity to the design. You have to use data from "src/shared/data/portfolio.js" to populate the components. Use only the data required in the design, let the rest data be used in future steps after my instructions on them. Right now, phase 1 is to just implement the design as is, nothing more, nothing less. I want pixel-perfect implementation. Analyse the screenshots very carefully and implement accordingly. All the components must be responsive as per the design.

Log all implementation details in `v2-implementation/implementation-log.md` and track component completion in `v2-implementation/components-checklist.md`. 
Update `progress.md` upon completion. Keep updating current-task.md with progress notes and next steps.
